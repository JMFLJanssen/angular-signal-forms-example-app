<h2 mat-dialog-title>Why hide a required title?</h2>
<mat-dialog-content>
    A chapter must have a title to be clearly identified in the form's chapter list. However, it's
    not necessary to actually display this title in the article. For example, suppose you want to
    insert a full-page photo. You can do this by deselecting "Show title" and simply adding a photo
    to the chapter.
